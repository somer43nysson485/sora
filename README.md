    loadstring(game:HttpGetAsync("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crowsyndrome/sora/refs/heads/main/main.luau"))()
    ```
    Alternatively, if you have the full script content:
2.  **Copy the Full Script:** Copy the entire Sora script code.
3.  **Execute:**
    *   Open your Roblox script executor.
    *   Paste the loadstring (or the full script) into the executor.

local Sora = {
	keys = {
		prefix = Enum.KeyCode.Quote,    -- Key to open the command bar
		teleport = Enum.KeyCode.LeftAlt, -- Key for click teleport
	},
	customization = {
		accent = Color3.fromRGB(131, 195, 248), -- UI color
		notificationSound = "rbxassetid://89087762338808", -- Notification sound
		bootSound = "rbxassetid://136242004757394",        -- Startup sound
